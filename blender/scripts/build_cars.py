"""The garage's supercars: a Lambo (a low, sharp wedge with a wing) and a Ferrari (curvy, a long
hood and big rear haunches). Modelled by this script and exported to src/client/models/cars.glb for
src/client/features/cars/world.ts, which paints each car its own colour. The shared helpers are in
aokit.py and the conventions in blender/README.md.

Headless, from the repo root (`-- --shots` also writes a review sheet of each car):

    blender --background --factory-startup --python blender/scripts/build_cars.py [-- --shots]

Each car is five roots, named after its kind:
  <kind>          the body, with the rear wheels, lights, intakes, mirrors (and the Lambo's wing)
  <kind>_top      the glass cabin and its painted roof, which the office takes off while anyone's in it
  <kind>_open     what's left with the roof off: the windshield (see-through Screen), the dashboard, two
                  bucket seats and the steering wheel
  <kind>_wheel_l  the front wheels, each with its origin at its hub: the office turns them to steer
  <kind>_wheel_r

All stand on the floor at the origin under the car's middle, nose forward, in the old code-built cars'
footprint (shared/garage.ts's CAR: 4.6 long, 2 wide), wheels where they were, so the colliders, the
seats and the camera stay as they are. Roots and material names are a contract with
features/cars/world.ts and tests/cars-model.test.ts: rename them in all three places.

The body is lofted: a smooth cross-section (a rounded rectangle, narrower at the top) at stations nose
to tail, each with its own width, sill, height and how much higher its fenders stand than its middle,
splined between, then wheel arches cut into the fenders.
