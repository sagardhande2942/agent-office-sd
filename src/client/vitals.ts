 * How you're doing: how much energy you've got left in you and how wound up you are. Both drift
 * away slowly while you're in the office — energy over ENERGY_SECONDS, and the stress building over
 * STRESS_SECONDS — and what you drink is what puts them back: a cup from the kitchen's coffee machine
 * or a can of Diet Coke off the fridge's shelf (or a cask of ale on the castle) puts energy back, a
 * drink from the rooftop bar takes the stress off, each drink saying how much of each it does in
 * shared/rooftop.ts. Running low, your legs get heavy; wound up past half, your hands and the view
 * shake. Run one right out and you keel over where you stand (see faint.ts), and come round outside
 * the building with both meters full. They're yours alone, like your coffee buzz (caffeine.ts) and
 * how drunk you are (booze.ts). Times are seconds, on whichever clock the caller passes in as `now`.
