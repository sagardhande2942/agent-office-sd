/**
 * The floor-host wire: what a member's machine and the office say to each other.
 *
 * Everything here is written from scratch. There is no runtime schema anywhere in the office to
 * borrow — `handleMessage`'s switch has no `default`, an unknown `t` is silently dropped, and every
 * case re-coerces its own fields — so the frames below validate themselves.
 *
 * Two shapes travel over the socket, and both are already JSON in the office:
 *
 *   office → host   the 54 messages `handleMessage` acts on a `Floor` (FLOOR_CASES), plus the three
 *                   it reaches another way (HOST_CALLS)
 *   host → office   whatever the floor's `FloorContext.emit` would have delivered locally
 *
 * so the payload is `ClientMsg` and `ServerMsg` themselves rather than a new vocabulary. What is new
 * is the envelope: `seq` for ordering (finding 11), `droppable` for back-pressure, and `floorId` on
 * everything, because one connection carries N floors (decision 6).
 *
 * See docs/remote-agents-plan.md.
