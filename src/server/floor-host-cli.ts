/**
 * `agent-office floor-host` — the office's side of the socket, run on the member's machine.
 *
 * One command, one connection, outbound only. It dials the office, pairs with a code the first time
 * (or with the token it kept), and then serves whatever floors the office asks it for out of `dir`s
 * on this machine. Nothing inbound: close the laptop or kill this and the floors go offline.
 *
 *   # first time, on the member's machine
 *   agent-office floor-host --office wss://bob.ngrok.app --code 5AVK-3NFP
 *
 *   # after that
 *   agent-office floor-host --office wss://bob.ngrok.app
 *
 * Where each floor lives is *the office's* list, not this one's: it is sent in `welcome`, from the
 * `FloorDef.host` and `FloorDef.dir` the office already holds. So the office decides what runs here,
 * and this command decides only whether to answer — which is the asymmetry the design rests on.
 *
 * The token it keeps is written at 0600 in the host's own home. A machine that has never paired gets
 * its token in `welcome`, so nobody has to carry one between machines.

const USAGE = `Usage: agent-office floor-host --office <url> [options]

Serve floors for an office on someone else's machine. Dials out to the office and holds the
connection; nothing here listens for anything.

  --office <url>       the office's address, e.g. wss://bob.ngrok.app or ws://localhost:4600
  --code <code>        pair for the first time, with the code from \`agent-office hosts pair\`
  --name <name>        what the office calls this machine, e.g. "Alice's laptop" (first pairing only)
  --seats <n>          how many workers this machine will seat across its floors (default 0)
  --projects <dir>     where this machine keeps its checkouts (default ~/work, env AGENT_OFFICE_PROJECTS).
                       Told to the office so it can suggest a path when pointing a floor here
  --config <path>      where to keep the token (default ~/.agent-office-floor-host.json)
  -h, --help           this

Once paired, the token is kept at 0600 and reused. The office sends the floors to serve; this machine
only has to have the checkouts they name. Revoke it with \`agent-office hosts revoke <id>\` on the
office and it is refused at the next connection.`;
