/**
 * What the office may ask of a floor, wherever that floor runs.
 *
 * `Floor` is the implementation that runs on this machine. `RemoteFloor` (coming with the floor
 * hosts) implements the same surface by shipping the request over the socket instead of calling it,
 * which is why the shape here is deliberately the *union* of what `server.ts` calls on a floor —
 * nothing more. A method here exists because a `handleMessage` case needs it, not because the class
 * happens to have it.
 *
 * Why an interface rather than moving the 50 floor-scoped cases into a function: those cases span
 * ~900 lines inside a switch that closes over a dozen office-side accessors (`here`, `worker`,
 * `withForge`, `warn`, `toastFloor`, `planChanged`, `floors`, `DESK_BY_ID`, `CLEANUPS`). Extracting
 * them is a large mechanical diff into a file where every line is load-bearing. This way the call
 * sites do not change at all — they already read `floor.workers.spawn(...)` — and only the object
 * behind `floor` becomes either a local `Floor` or a proxy.
 *
 * Split deliberately:
 *
 *   - **reads** return a value, so a hosted floor answers from its last known state;
 *   - **writes** return `string` for a refusal the caller shows, which is how the office already
 *     handles every failure (a refusal names the machine, never the person: see the permission model).
 *
 * See docs/remote-agents-plan.md, seam 2.
