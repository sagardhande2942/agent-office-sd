/**
 * The host machine's side of the connection: a real `Floor` per floor the office asked for, and the
 * socket to report into.
 *
 * This is what makes "hosting a floor" mean something. The `Floor` here is the *same class* the office
 * runs for its own floors — its own `WorkerManager`, `TaskQueue`, `Forge` and `Changes`, on this disk,
 * with this machine's sign-ins. Nothing about a floor forks for being hosted; only the `FloorContext`
 * differs, and it differs in one way: what would have gone to people in the same process goes up the
 * socket instead.
 *
 * Which members are local and which cross the wire is the answer to decision 9, and the split is the
 * security story:
 *
 *   **local**     `agentCmd`, `agentArgs`, `dshProfile`, `hook`, `ledger`, `capacity`, `prompts`,
 *                 `leaveOnMerge`. This machine's own settings; a floor cannot be built without them.
 *   **upward**    `emit`, `toast`, `termData`, `changes`, `workerChanged`, `pullsChanged`. Everything
 *                 a floor would have said to the room goes over the socket, so the office and its
 *                 people see the floor as they always have.
 *   **withheld**  `runAs` and `forgeAs`, both per-account **sign-ins**. Deliberately absent: a hosted
 *                 floor runs on this machine's own, and the office cannot hand it anyone's
 *                 credentials. `floor(id)` is withheld for the same kind of reason — a worker here
 *                 must not reach into a checkout on the office's disk (finding 9).
