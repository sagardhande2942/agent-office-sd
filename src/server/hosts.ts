The machines allowed to host floors in this office. A machine pairs once with a code, and is then
admitted until it is revoked. Its token is shown once, at pairing, and never stored.

Commands:
  list                        the machines allowed to host floors here, and whether each is connected
  pair [--name <name>]        make a pairing code (single use, 30 minutes). --name pre-labels the machine
  revoke <id|name>            end it: the machine is refused at the next connection, and cannot be re-claimed
  seats <id|name> <n>         how many workers that machine will seat across all its floors
  accept <id|name> <on|off>   whether an automation hire may seat there. A person may always hire.
  add-floor <id|name> <repo>  put a floor on that machine, with the checkout it already has there
  rm-floor <floor>            take a floor off the building (by id, or by owner/name)

Options:
  -d, --dir <path>            the office's directory (default: the office in this folder, or ~/agent-office)
  --checkout <path>           add-floor: where the checkout is **on that machine**. Defaults to the
                              machine's own projects folder when it has reported one
  --floor <name>              add-floor: what to call the floor (default: the repository's name)

A pairing code is read by the person on the other machine. Only its holder can claim it, and it is
spent whether or not they keep the token.

\`add-floor\` writes the building, not the office: floors.json is read when the office starts, so
restart it to see the floor. It does not clone anything and does not check that the path exists —
the checkout is on that machine, and the machine is the one that finds out whether it is really
there (it says so, by name, when it connects).`;
