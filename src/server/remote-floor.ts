/**
 * A floor that runs on someone else's machine.
 *
 * The office holds this where it would otherwise hold a `Floor`, and calls exactly the same methods —
 * `server.ts` does not know the difference. What changes is where the work happens: a call is shipped
 * over that machine's socket instead of run here, and the answer comes back the same way.
 *
 * Three kinds of method, three behaviours, and the difference matters:
 *
 *   **writes** ship a frame and wait for the reply. The reply is either the result or a refusal
 *   `string`, which is how every other refusal in the office already reports itself.
 *
 *   **reads** do not ship at all. The host streams worker updates and board state upward the moment
 *   they change, so the office already holds them and `list()` or `queue.state()` costs nothing. This
 *   is why the last known state is kept here rather than fetched on demand.
 *
 *   **events** (`changes.watch` and friends) ship and return nothing, because they push. What comes
 *   back is an `event` frame, delivered by `FloorContext.changes` on the host's side.
 *
 * **A sleeping machine is a refusal, never a failure.** Every call here resolves to a message naming
 * it, and the queue is told to keep the task (finding 10). Nothing throws at the caller, because a
 * laptop in a bag is not an error.
 *
 * **Three things are refused outright** rather than proxied: the whiteboard, the dog and the docs.
 * All three are files in the floor's own data directory, so serving them would mean the office
 * reading a checkout it must never touch. Refusing with the machine's name is honest; proxying every
 * whiteboard stroke across the internet is a latency question that has not been measured yet, and
 * that is worth measuring before designing (see docs/remote-agents-plan.md, "the gaps").
